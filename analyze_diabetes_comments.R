# One of the comments this yielded was interesting for answering our question. ``8  There is so much going on in this
#field right now. In the past, people were pretty limited in what they could do with technology to manage their diabetes,
#because the type of technology wasn't considered in the FDA approval process (i.e. it had to jump through all the 
#same hoops that a new pump model would, even if it was just an app that was reading data, not writing it). Even at 
#that time, people were still coming up with ideas. In particular, I can think of a user here who set up an IFTTT 
#program that would let him text his sugar to a number and then it would be automatically logged in a Google spreadsheet.
#He shared the code here and I was able to set it up for myself, too. I probably still have the code snippet somewhere.
#\n\nNow there has been a proliferation of diabetes related apps. There are some that gamify your care. An example is 
#[MySugr](https://mysugr.com/) where you make very detailed log entries to get more points to "feed the monster" and 
#if you hit a certain number ... <truncated>""
